## Evented Programming with Node.js

Node.js is server-side Javascript with a programming model that is based on
non-blocking IO. It is becoming increasingly more popular since it enables us
to write scalable network programs with ease.

In this presentation you will learn about asynchronous or event-driven
programming in Node. I will show you tools for testing, debugging, and
deployment. You will get an overview of some popular frameworks. And, I
will demonstrate techniques for dealing with the problems that arise with
asynchronous programming.

Get ready for Javascript on the server!

Anders Janmyr is a developer, architect, speaker, and writer.

He loves the combination of dynamic languages and test-driven
development since it gives him both rapid feedback and a strong
confidence that what he is doing is correct. 

Along with programming he also enjoys other parts of the software development
cycle, such as build systems, deployment scripting, and project methods.
He believes that tight feedback loops are essential to the well-being of both
people and projects. To achieve tight feedback he is a firm proponent of
continuous delivery and automation. Everything that can should be automated.

He has worked in many different domains, from databases and servers to
mobile phones and robots, and has experience with small and large scale
architectures. 

He has a wide experience of programming languages including, Javascript, Ruby,
Smalltalk, Haskell, Lisp, and C#.
