## Asynchronous Programming with Node.js

Node.js is one of the hottest things in programming right now. What is
it and why is it hot? 

In this presentation you will learn about asynchronous or event-driven
programming in Node. I will show you tools for testing, debugging, and
deployment. You will get an overview of some popular frameworks. And, I
will demonstrate techniques for dealing with the problems that arise with
asynchronous programming.

Get ready for Javascript on the server!
